Flowseal/zapret-discord-youtube
"Plug & Play" for bypassing blocks on foreign platforms, Discord, and YouTube for Windows. Contains website lists, IP address lists, and presets for zapret.

Customizable presets allow you to quickly configure the component on the fly without having to delve deeply into its operating principles. However, sometimes this may not be sufficient.

Presets can only work with a specific version of zapret. You should not update zapret or a preset if everything works.

The effectiveness of a particular strategy depends on many factors. Try different strategies (ALT, MGTS, and others) until you find a solution that works for you.

*Blocking strategies change over time. A particular zapret bypass strategy may work for a while, but if the blocking method or the way it's detected changes, it will stop working. <There appears to be no help available for this section at this time>*
