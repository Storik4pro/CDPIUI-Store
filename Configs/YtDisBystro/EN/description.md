An easily editable launch configuration set for the zapret component from the author of KDS. Contains site lists, IP address lists, and configuration sets for zapret.

Easily editable configuration sets allow you to add or remove predefined configuration lines. This allows experienced users to easily adapt the strategy to any needs.

Configuration sets can only work with a specific version of zapret. You shouldn't update zapret or a configuration set if everything works. "If it works, don't touch it."

#### Thanks and special thanks to:
**bolvan** - for the wonderful zapret program
**Ori** - for the fake Quik and other useful ideas
To all involved users of the [ntc.party](https://ntc.party/) forum - for new knowledge, communication, and even awkward questions. Without you, none of this would have happened.
